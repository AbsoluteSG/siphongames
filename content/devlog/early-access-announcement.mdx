We've been building this game quietly for a long time. Starting today, it's not quiet anymore.

No Dogs Allowed is in early access. Here's what that means, in plain terms.

## What's in the Build

The early access build contains the full first chapter of the game, which takes roughly eight to twelve hours depending on how much side content you pursue. This includes:

- The complete restaurant management loop
- All five weapon classes and their associated relic slots
- Three of the five city districts (The Flat, Greymark, and the western half of The Span)
- The main story through the end of Act One
- Approximately sixty percent of the planned NPC roster

The combat system, the restaurant system, and the social-network layer are all in a state we're confident in. These systems won't change fundamentally from here.

## What Isn't in the Build

Two districts aren't accessible yet — The Underline and The Remnant. Act Two content isn't in. A significant portion of side quest content is missing or in placeholder state. The New Game Plus mode is designed but not implemented.

We're being direct about this because we think players deserve to know what they're buying. Early access isn't a preview — it's a real purchase, and you should know what you're getting.

## The Roadmap

Our target is full release within eight months of today. Between now and then:

**Q1:** Second district drop (The Underline), additional NPC content, combat balance patch based on early access feedback.

**Q2:** Third district drop (The Remnant), Act Two main story content, New Game Plus.

**Q3:** Final polish, remaining side quests, full release.

We'll post here when those milestones land. Thank you for playing.
