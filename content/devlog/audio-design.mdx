This post is a draft. It won't appear in the public devlog until published.

## Audio Philosophy

The sound design lives between two poles — the warmth and controlled chaos of a working kitchen, and the spare, tense quiet of operative work at night. Getting both right required us to think of them not as separate contexts but as a continuous spectrum.

When the player moves from the restaurant to the street, the audio transition needs to feel like a genuine shift in stakes. That transition is doing a lot of narrative work.

## The Kitchen Soundscape

We recorded roughly forty hours of actual kitchen audio — prep work, service during rush, the ambient hum of equipment. Almost none of it was used directly. Real kitchen audio is chaotic in a way that reads as noise rather than texture.

What we built instead is a constructed kitchen soundscape that feels real without being accurate. The rhythms are slightly more musical than reality. Sounds layer in ways that feel organic but are actually carefully sequenced.
