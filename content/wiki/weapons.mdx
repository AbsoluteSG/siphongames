<WikiSection id="overview" title="Weapon Overview">

Weapons in No Dogs Allowed are found, purchased, or crafted. They do not degrade. Each weapon has a base damage value, a stamina cost per swing, and a secondary stat that modifies combat behavior.

Weapons cannot be upgraded directly — secondary stats are modified through equippable relics.

<WikiSection id="tier-list" title="Tier Rankings">

Rankings reflect general utility across all encounter types. Personal playstyle will shift individual results.

<WikiSection id="relics" title="Relic Interactions" collapsible>

Each weapon has between one and three relic slots. Relics modify secondary behavior — expanding parry windows, adding status effects on hit, or altering stamina recovery.

<WikiCallout type="tip">
  The Ironlung Relic is compatible with all weapon classes and is generally considered the highest-value relic in the game.
