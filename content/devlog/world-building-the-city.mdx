The city doesn't have a name. This was deliberate.

Early in development we had several candidates — Velmoor, the Pale Stack, Graymark Province. All of them got cut. A named city becomes a destination. An unnamed city becomes a feeling. We wanted players to project onto it, to make it theirs.

## Layers of Time

The first design rule we established: every district should feel like it was built on top of something older. Streets that don't quite align. Buildings with mismatched stone. A drainage system that pre-dates the current neighbourhood by three generations.

This isn't just visual texture. It implies a history of collapse and reconstruction that informs the city's politics. The powerful factions didn't build this place — they inherited it, contested it, and plastered their symbols over older ones. Players who look closely will find the older symbols underneath.

## The Five Districts

We settled on five playable districts, each with a distinct personality:

**The Flat** is the city's working floor. Low ceilings, exposed pipes, restaurants crammed shoulder-to-shoulder. This is where the player's restaurant sits. The people here aren't poor exactly — they're just not rich. There's a specific kind of dignity to that.

**Greymark** is the institutional district. Administrative buildings. Syndicate offices. Clean sightlines — the kind of urban layout that's designed for surveillance. Moving through Greymark at night is a different kind of tension than moving through the Flat.

**The Underline** is what's below everything else. Maintenance tunnels, old transit, storage. It's the city's unconscious. Some of the best lore in the game exists here and will never be seen by most players.

**The Span** is the elevated commercial district — sky bridges, glass shopfronts, the city's performance of prosperity. Most NPCs here are performing a version of themselves.

**The Remnant** is what's left of the original city before the Collapse. Partially reclaimed, partially forbidden. We haven't decided yet how much of it will be accessible in early access.

## The Rule We Keep

In every environment pass, we ask a single question: *what happened here before the player arrived?* If we can't answer that, the space isn't ready. This sounds simple. In practice it forces a discipline that keeps the world from feeling like a set.
