When we first pitched the game, the elevator version was: *you run a restaurant by day and do operative work by night.* It sounded like a clever juxtaposition. The problem we ran into almost immediately is that clever juxtapositions don't automatically become good game design.

The restaurant half needed to be more than a backdrop. It needed to be a system that interlocked with the operative half, or it was just two separate games wearing the same title.

## The Resource Bridge

The solution was to make the restaurant a resource engine for the night operations.

Running a successful service earns coin, which buys upgraded equipment. More practically, regular customers become a social network. The broker who can get you a building schematic is also a three-times-a-week lunch regular. The city official whose access codes you need comes in every Sunday. You build these relationships across tables, not just across missions.

This creates a layered motivation for doing the restaurant work well. You're not just surviving — you're cultivating an operation.

## Service as a Skill System

We wanted the restaurant service to feel like something you get better at, not just something you manage. The current system has four core service skills: prep speed, order memory, reading regulars, and recovery (handling complaints without losing the table).

Each skill has a visible progression and affects the social outcomes with customers. A player who's built up their *reading regulars* skill will unlock dialogue options that a less-experienced operator won't see. These options aren't always advantageous — sometimes knowing a regular too well means they'll ask for things you can't give.

## The Menu as a Weapon

One late addition that changed the feel of the whole system: the menu is editable. Players can adjust what they serve based on who they expect. Certain dishes attract certain customer types. A menu heavy on inexpensive staples brings in Flat residents — less money per cover, but higher volume and deeper loyalty. A menu tilted toward expensive or unusual items attracts Span patrons — bigger coin, more volatile relationships.

This connects back to the operative side. If you need access to a specific faction, you tilt the menu toward their regulars. If you need to keep a low profile, you run a quiet house.

## What's Still in Progress

The current build has a working service loop but the *reading regulars* skill needs more content behind it. Right now it reveals existing information faster. Eventually it should surface information that isn't available any other way. That's the design goal — we're not there yet.
