<WikiSection id="overview" title="The World">

No Dogs Allowed takes place in a sprawling city that has outgrown its infrastructure and its ideals. Once a model of civic order, the city now operates through an uneasy arrangement of competing factions, black markets, and heavily enforced zoning laws that nobody fully understands.

The player inhabits the lower districts — dense, loud, and alive — where restaurants, clinics, and repair shops fill every ground floor.

<WikiSection id="the-collapse" title="The Slow Collapse">

The city is not falling apart dramatically. It is declining quietly — in cancelled maintenance contracts, in water pressure that drops at midnight, in streets that get narrower each decade as permit approvals stall.

This gradual erosion is the backdrop of the game. Nothing is catastrophic. Everything is slightly worse than it used to be.

<WikiCallout type="info">
  The setting deliberately avoids a single inciting disaster. The tension is systemic, not event-driven.

<WikiSection id="mythology" title="Mythology & Belief">

The city has a folk religion built around a figure called the Inspector — a bureaucratic deity associated with final audits, last meals, and the closure of accounts. Shrines appear in basements and alleyways.

Whether the Inspector is real, metaphorical, or something else entirely is left unresolved by the game.

<WikiSection id="language" title="Language & Naming">

Districts are named by function, then by number, then by the names residents gave them once the official names stopped sticking. The restaurant at the center of the game has three names, depending on who you ask.
