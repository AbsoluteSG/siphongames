<WikiSection id="overview" title="Character Overview">

No Dogs Allowed features a deliberately small cast of named characters. Each one has a defined relationship to the restaurant, the city's factions, and the player's choices.

Characters do not level up. They change based on what you do — or fail to do — for them over the course of the game.

<WikiSection id="minor" title="Minor & Unnamed Characters">

Several recurring unnamed characters — the morning inspector, the tenant from the third floor, the regular who only orders water — have dedicated dialogue trees and respond to world state changes.

<WikiCallout type="tip">
  Minor characters often carry quest flags. Speaking to them after major story beats can unlock alternate paths.
