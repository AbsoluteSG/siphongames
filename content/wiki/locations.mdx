<WikiSection id="overview" title="The City">

The game takes place across a single city rendered in full. Locations are divided into districts, each with its own atmosphere, faction presence, and density of interactable elements.

Fast travel is limited — the city is designed to be traversed. Each route between districts reveals different environmental storytelling.

The restaurant functions as the game's hub. Its appearance and layout change based on upgrades purchased and story events completed. Certain characters only appear here at specific times of day.

<WikiCallout type="info">
  The restaurant's back room contains a hidden access point that is flagged in Chapter 2. Investigate it before progressing to Chapter 3.

<WikiSection id="secrets" title="Secret Areas" collapsible>

Several areas are accessible only through non-obvious means — completing specific dialogue chains, acquiring certain items, or visiting locations at particular times.

Secret areas typically contain lore documents, rare items, and optional character encounters. None are required for story completion.
