<WikiSection id="overview" title="Story Overview">

The main story of No Dogs Allowed spans four chapters and one epilogue. Each chapter is divided into day and night segments — the restaurant operates during the day, field operations run at night.

Choices made in one chapter affect available options in subsequent chapters. No choice is irreversible until the end of Chapter 3.
