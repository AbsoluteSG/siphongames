<WikiSection id="about" title="About the Game">

No Dogs Allowed is an action-RPG set in a densely layered urban world. You play as a restaurant owner navigating a city in slow collapse — managing a kitchen by day and surviving its streets by night.

The game blends real-time combat with resource management, dialogue-driven faction politics, and a richly detailed world built around the tension between routine and survival.
