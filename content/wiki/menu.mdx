<WikiSection id="overview" title="The Menu">

The restaurant's menu evolves over the course of the game. You begin with three dishes and unlock new items through story progression, customer relationships, and ingredient sourcing.

Each dish has a base satisfaction value, a preparation time, and optional modifiers from how the player manages the kitchen in real time.

<WikiSection id="unlockable" title="Unlockable Dishes">

Additional dishes become available as you progress through the game. Unlock conditions vary — some require story flags, others require sourcing specific ingredients from faction vendors.

<WikiCallout type="tip">
  The Midnight Set — unlocked in Chapter 3 — has the highest satisfaction ceiling in the game but requires three rare ingredients simultaneously.

<WikiSection id="pricing" title="Pricing & Margins">

Each dish has a base price and a price ceiling. Charging above the base risks customer complaints. Charging at ceiling during demand spikes maximizes income but affects reputation with regulars.
