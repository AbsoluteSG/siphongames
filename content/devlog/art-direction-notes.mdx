The first fifty concept images we produced for No Dogs Allowed were thrown out. Not iterated on — thrown out. We had made something technically competent and completely without a point of view.

This post is about how we found the actual visual language of the game, and what it's trying to say.

## The Wrong Directions

Early concepts pulled in three irreconcilable directions at once.

One stream was gritty realism — cracked concrete, naturalistic lighting, desaturated palettes. Respectable, but it looked like every other game set in a city. Another stream went stylised and warm — exaggerated proportions, almost cartoonish. It was appealing but it didn't fit the tone of the writing. The third stream went full noir: extreme contrast, heavy black shadows. It looked great in still images and unreadable in motion.

We needed a synthesis.

## What We Landed On

The palette is built around controlled warmth against cold infrastructure. The city itself is cool — greys, muted blues, the greenish-white of overhead fluorescents. The human spaces — the restaurant, the player's apartment, the places where people actually live — pull warm. Amber. Terracotta. The colour of something that's being maintained against the odds.

Character silhouettes prioritise readability over realism. You should be able to identify who someone is in a crowded, poorly lit corridor before you can see their face. This is partly gameplay necessity and partly a statement: in this world, people are legible by their role before they're legible as individuals.

## Lighting as Narrative

We use two light temperatures as a consistent language. Interior warmth means safety, or the illusion of it. Cold exterior light means exposure. When the player moves from a warm kitchen into a dark street, the temperature shift should feel like a decision.

> The restaurant is always lit like someone lives there. Because someone does.

Some of the environmental lighting went through eight or nine passes before it felt right. It's the kind of work that's invisible when it's done correctly — which is exactly the point.

## Ongoing Work

We're currently in a second full pass on character costume design. The first pass was functional; the second pass is expressive. We're also revisiting some of the Greymark district lighting, which currently reads too clean. That district should feel like something is being hidden, not just polished.

Screenshots in the next devlog, once we're happy with the state of things.
